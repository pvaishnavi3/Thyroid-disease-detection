**Thyroid Disease Detection using Machine Learning**
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of thyroid disease in individuals using a machine learning model. 
It leverages a dataset of various health features to determine whether a person is at risk of having thyroid disease or not. 
The goal of the project is to provide an automated system for early detection, helping to reduce diagnosis time and improve patient care.

**Features:**
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

Machine Learning Model: Uses a classification algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to predict thyroid disease.

GUI Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface using Python's Tkinter library for easy interaction.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

**Technologies Used:**
Python: Core programming language.

Tkinter: Used for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

Machine Learning Libraries:

scikit-learn for model building.

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical operations.

matplotlib for visualizing data and results.
